# mce2018
An implementation of an open-set speaker recognition system for the 1st Multi-target speaker detection and identification Challenge Evaluation (MCE 2018, http://mce2018.org/).

The PLDA script is an adaptation of the MATLAB files of the fastPLDA toolkit (see https://sites.google.com/site/fastplda/) to Python.

You can simply run the script evaluate_system.py which will do everything automatically.
